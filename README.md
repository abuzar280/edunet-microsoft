This repository contains the Python code for implementing a solution to the "Predictive Analytics for Optimizing Training Program Effectiveness" case study. The code addresses the challenge of predicting training program success rates and recommending high-impact courses aligned with job market demands.

## Purpose

The code provides a simplified implementation of the following:

* **Data Simulation:** Generates synthetic data for learners, courses, enrollment, employee performance, and job market trends.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Trains machine learning models (Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) to predict course completion and post-training career impact.
* **Recommendation Engine:** Implements a basic course recommendation system based on learner enrollment history and job market demand.
* **Visualization:** Creates a sample visualization (bar chart of course completion rates).
* **Validation:** Performs cross-validation to evaluate model performance.
* **Metrics Calculation:** Calculates key success metrics, such as course completion rate, promotion rate, and average salary growth.

## How to Run the Code

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib plotly
    ```
3.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the main Python script:
    ```bash
    python training_program_optimization.py
    ```
    The script will:
    * Generate the simulated data.
    * Train the predictive models.
    * Print model performance metrics.
    * Print course recommendations for a sample learner.
    * Display a plot of course completion rates.
    * Print cross-validation scores.
    * Print overall success metrics.

## File Description

* `training_program_optimization.py`: The main Python script containing the code for data simulation, predictive modeling, recommendation engine, visualization, validation, and metrics calculation.
* `README.md`: This file, providing a description of the code and instructions on how to run it.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following Python libraries:

* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical computations.
* [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For machine learning algorithms.
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): For creating plots and visualizations.
* [plotly](https://plotly.com/): For creating interactive plots.

## Assumptions and Limitations

* **Simulated Data:** The code uses simulated data, which may not perfectly reflect real-world scenarios.
* **Simplified Recommendation Engine:** The course recommendation system is a simplified implementation and does not include advanced NLP techniques or time-series forecasting.
* **Basic Visualizations:** The dashboard component is represented by a single example visualization. A full dashboard would require additional development.

##  Next Steps

* The code can be extended to incorporate more realistic data and advanced techniques.
* The predictive models can be further optimized through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering.
* The recommendation engine can be improved by integrating NLP for better skill matching and time-series forecasting for trend analysis.
* A complete interactive dashboard can be developed using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
